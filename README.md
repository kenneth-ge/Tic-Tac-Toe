I'm super proud of my latest innovation -- using words to denote game rooms, rather than an arbitrary sequence of numbers (yay for readability and memorizability!)! Yet another example of me loving psychology and the humanities and applying this to a software project. I never understood Kahoot's 6 digit game codes -- always felt hard to memorize and unintuitive. I love my #humanities lol.
